# Composition
  - **Has a** relationship.
  - i.e. A class *Composite* can contain an Object of another class *Component*.
  - The relationship is that a *Composite* **has a** *Component*.

**Composite:** Classes that contain Objects of other classes

**Component:** Classes those Objects are being used in other classes to create a more complex type.


**Example**

  - The *House* class can be **Composed** by another Object of type *Door*.
  - So the Composition relationship states that a *House* **Has a** a *Door*.


  #### Difference between Composition and Inheritance
    - **Composition** alows you to reuse the same code by implementing Objects to other Objects. Like, both an *Office* and *House* **has a** *Door*
    - While **Inheritance** alows you to inherit the interface and implementation of other Classes.
